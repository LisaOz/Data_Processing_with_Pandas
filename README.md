# Data Processing with Pandas
This project demonstrates essential data processing techniques using Python's Pandas library, focusing on loading, analyzing, and manipulating CSV datasets. It covers a range of data manipulation tasks, including:

- Filtering datasets
- Calculating averages
- Adding new columns
- Exporting modified data

## Project Context
This project was developed as part of the Advanced Databases and Big Data module of the Software Engineering course. It serves as a practical application of data analysis concepts, emphasizing efficient handling and processing of large datasets using Python's Pandas library.

## Features
- **Loading CSV Data**: Load CSV files into Pandas DataFrames for manipulation and analysis.
- **Row Selection** : Display the first and last rows of the dataset to gain initial insights.
- **Column Selection**: Extract and display specific columns to focus on relevant data.
- **Handling Missing Data**: Manage missing values by either deleting rows with NaN values or filling them with calculated averages for cleaner analysis.
- **Adding New Columns**: Create custom columns as needed to facilitate further analysis.
- **Data Sorting**: Sort data in ascending or descending order based on one or more columns to highlight trends.
- **Calculating Averages**: Compute the average values for numeric columns to summarize data insights.
- **Exporting Modified Data**: Save the modified datasets as new CSV files in a zipped format for convenient storage and sharing.

## Techniques Used
- **JupyterLab**: For interactive data exploration and analysis.
- **Python 3.x**:  As the primary programming language.
- **Pandas Library**: For data manipulation and analysis.

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Download the project files by cloning the repository.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Data_Processing_with_Pandas.git
    ```
2. **Install Dependencies**: Install Pandas if it is not already installed.
    ```bash
    pip install pandas
    ```
3. **Prepare Data**: Place your CSV files in the project directory to make them accessible to the script.
4. **Run the Script**: Execute the script in JupyterLab or any Python environment to process the data and view outputs for each step.
5. **View Exported Files**: Modified CSV files will be saved in a zipped folder within the project directory after processing.
